## Downloading R and RStudio

The first stage of working with R is to download and install R and RStudio.

* You can install R here: <https://cran.rstudio.com/>

* You can install RStudio here: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
